The Dendron handbook is the central repository for how we run the Dendron organization.

This handbook is heavily inspired by the [gitlab handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook). 

It documents everything we stand for and everything we are working towards. It is a living document, a work in progress that will change and grow as we do.
