<p>Our hiring process changes depending on your history with Dendron. It consists of three phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>interview with the founder</li>
<li>interview with the team</li>
<li>2 week contracting gig</li>
</ul>
<p>If you've been a regular contributor to one of our open source projects  and have done at least few <a href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/1e6c8b49-ef88-4e79-b2df-e9d614c38a53.html#medium">medium</a> tasks, often we will skip the contracting part and hire you after the round of interviews. </p>
<p>Otherwise, we'll do a paid two week contracting gig where you will be doing the same job as what you would when working with us full time. We find this is a much better way of evaluating fit than a coding screen and gives both us and you a chance to make sure we work well together. </p>
