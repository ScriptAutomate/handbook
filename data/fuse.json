The wealth of information in this note can be overwhelming at times. It's okay to skim through resources, bookmark them and come back at a later time.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- Day 1: [Getting Started: Intro, Accounts and Paperwork](#day-1-getting-started-accounts-and-paperwork)\n- Day 2: [Morning: Remote Working and our Values](#day-2-remote-working-and-our-values)\n- Day 3: [Morning: Social](#day-3-social)\n- Day 4: [Morning: Git](#day-4-git)\n- Etc: [Job Specific Tasks](#job-specific-tasks)\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis is your core onboarding to work at Dendron. It has been crafted with the [three dimensions of remote onboarding](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/onboarding/) in mind, namely: Organizational Onboarding, Technical Onboarding and Social Onboarding.\n\n## Support and our Single Source of Truth\n\nSince Dendron aspires to be a [handbook first](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/) organization, the answer to question you may have particularly throughout your first thirty days should be documented and readily available in the [handbook](http://handbook.dendron.so). If you are unable to find the information you are looking for, please reach out on the `#dendron-team` channel in Discord and update the handbook once you find the answer.\n\n## The First Thirty Days\n\nThis note consists of a series of tasks which should be completed sequentially over the course of the next thirty days structured as follows:\n\n| Day        | Area of Focus                                |\n| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| **Day 01** | Intro, Accounts, Paperwork, First Task       |\n| **Day 02** | Remote Work: Communication and Values        |\n| **Day 03** | Organizational Structure and Social Elements |\n| **Day 04** | Introduction to Dendron and using Github     |\n\n\nThough you may be eager to jump right into your role we encourage you to set aside dedicated time every day for your first week to focus on these tasks as they are geared toward ensuring you are enabled to [thrive in an all-remote environment](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/onboarding/#the-importance-of-onboarding).\n\n## Continuous Improvement\n\nIn the interests of [[passing it forward|dendron://dendron.handbook/handbook.company.values#pass-it-forward]], we encourage you to suggest changes and updates to this note and the handbook, both of which can be done via Pull Request (PR).\n\nAlong with this you will complete onboarding on Day Thirty by being asked to fill out the [Onboarding Satisfaction Survey](https://airtable.com/shrcILcL6cm6lpCZt), which is an opportunity to share feedback on your general Onboarding Experience.\n\n## Day 1 - Getting Started: Accounts and Paperwork\n\n- NOTE1: the best way to follow along in this onboarding is by using the preview. You can run `Dendron: Show Preview` by selecting it from the [command prompt](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/rLlUBUvNmv5gu9YmZfUJE.html).\n- NOTE2: relative links currently don't work in the preview (this is currently being addressed). To navigate links, hover over a link in the editor and use `CTRL+Enter` to navigate\n\n#### Daily Journal Note\n\nThis is how we do standups at Dendron\n\n- [ ] Read over the sop[^sop] on [[handbook.sop.daily-journal]]\n- [ ] Open your daily journal note for today. It should be in the format of `user.{{ALIAS}}.{{date}}`. Your manager should have created this one for you. You're responsible for maintaining your own journals for future dates. You can read more about the format [[here|schemas.user#dailyjournal]] \n   - NOTE: to create a daily journal, we recommend [[pinning|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.guides.tips#pinning-tabs]] your current daily journal and then using lookup to update the day component at the end of the day to create the daily journal for the next day\n\n![[Hourly|templates.people.onboarding.hourly]]\n\n#### 2FA \n\nDendron requires you to enable 2FA[^2fa]\n\nThis absolutely must be done within a week or you will be locked out and need to wait for an admin to get around to helping you get reconnected.\n\n- [ ]  Enable [two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/configuring-two-factor-authentication) on your Github account.\n\n<!-- full timers only --->\n- [ ]  Enable 2FA on your Dendron email account (Gmail/GSuite) (this should have been an option to do when you first received the invitation to the account).\n\n#### Rippling\n\nRippling is our HRIS (Human Resource Information System) for all team members. This section is super important to ensure payroll + operations support\n\n- [ ] Access the Rippling [Dashboard](https://app.rippling.com) and make sure you complete any outstanding tasks assigned to you.\n- [ ] For contractors being paid by the hour, it may be useful to save an invoice template for future use. An invoice template can be found in Google Docs by searching `Invoice Template` or [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1faslC4H_NSLsk8jd8xUuwgAjqhkdSlaI0D1WINA1y9Y/edit#gid=0).\n- [ ] Don't forget to comply with the contract you signed, and make sure you understand [Intellectual Property](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/code-of-conduct/#intellectual-property-and-protecting-ip).\n\n#### User Intro\n- [ ] Create and add your own [[user readme|templates.user-readme]]. This goes in `user.{{ALIAS}}` \n   - NOTE: this may take some time to create so please feel free to iterate on it over the course of the week\n\n#### Discord\n\n- [ ] Register on Discord by following this [invitation link](https://discord.gg/xrKTUStHNZ). Read the next suggestions on how to choose a username first.\n   - [ ] You can use your personal discord OR choose to create a new username using your Dendron email. It's generally helpful to choose a username to be the same as your Github handle, for consistency and ease of use.\n- [ ] Make sure your Discord profile has a **photo** - it makes it easier for other team members to remember you!\n- [ ] If you're new to Discord, a short primer can be found at [a Beginner's guide to Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord).\n- [ ] Make sure you have access to the `#dendron-team` channel and post an intro.\n   1. This can be the [[About me|templates.user-readme#about-me]] that you used for your README\n   1. We love to hear more, such as where you were before, family/pets, and hobbies.\n   1. We also enjoy pictures if you're willing to share. Consider giving your new team members a glimpse into your world (scroll through previous messages in the channel for inspiration).\n\n#### Rpass\n<!-- Full time only -->\n- [ ] Install rpass. Dendron provides all team members with an account to rpass to help manage work credentials.\n\n#### Other\n- [ ] Accept calendar invite to the Dendron Company Calendar\n\n#### Initial Tasks\n\n- [ ] Go to [[Job-specific tasks|templates.people.onboarding#job-specific-tasks]] for role specific tasks\n- [ ] Go to your [[weekly journal|handbook.sop.weekly-journal]] at `user.{username}.weekly.{date}` to see your specific tasks\n\nIf at any point you find yourself stuck, don't hesitate to leave a question in the `#dendron-team` channel.\n* * *\n\n## Day 2 - Remote Working and our Values\n\n### Remote Work\n\n<!--Trial/Part-time optional-->\n\nThe first month at a remote company can be hard. **There is as much to unlearn as there is to learn**. Check out the resources below to help get you situated.\n\n- [ ]  If you're new to working in a 100% remote environment, read over the [Guide for starting a new remote role](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/getting-started/). You'll find other tips for operating (and thriving!) in an all-remote setting within the [All-Remote section of the Gitlab handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/). Take some inspiration from the folks at Gitlab on how they structure their remote working day, read this helpful blog post [A day in the life of remote worker](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/06/18/day-in-the-life-remote-worker/)\n- [ ]  Learn more about the `#allremote` onboarding process and additional [best practices](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/learning-and-development/#how-do-you-onboard-new-team-members).\n   - [Adopting a Self-Service and Self-Learning Mentality Knowledge Assessment](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/self-service/#introduction)\n     (Day 1)\n   - [Informal Communication in an All-Remote Environment Knowledge Assessment](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication)\n   - [Embrace Asynchronous Communication](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous)\n   - [All-Remote Meetings](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/meetings)\n   - [Communicating Effectively and Responsibly Through Text](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/meetings/#how-do-you-do-all-remote-meetings-right)\n   - [Building and Reinforcing a Sustainable Culture Knowledge Assessment](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/building-culture/#gitlab-knowledge-assessment-building-and-reinforcing-a-sustainable-culture)\n   - [Combating Burnout, Isolation, and Anxiety in the Remote Workplace](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/mental-health)\n   - [The Non-Linear Workday](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/non-linear-workday)\n\n### Values\n\n1. [ ] Dendron values are a living document. Familiarize yourself with our [[values|handbook.company.values]]\n2. [ ] We are driven by our mission -  to help **people** organize and make sense of any amount of information.  Read our [[mission statement|handbook.company.mission]]\n3. [ ] Read over our [[handbook.company.key-principles]] which represent our operating system for making decisions and doing tasks.\n\n### Calendar\n<!--Trial/Part-time optional-->\n\n#### Set Up\n\n- [ ] Set your Google Calendar [default event duration](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/settings) to use `speedy meetings`\n- [ ] Set up [Calendly](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips/other-apps/#sts=Calendly). Calendly is a calendar tool that allows individuals to select open meeting slots in order to speak with others outside of Dendron. For Dendron team members, feel free to schedule directly through Google calendar. When you are setting up Calendly, there is no specific Dendron account. With the free version you will only be allowed one meeting time, but if you need to upgrade to a Pro account, you can do so and expense it.\n- [ ] Add the Zoom integration by going to the `Integrations` section at the top of the page. Find Zoom in the list of integrations and click it. It will then ask you to link your Calendly and Zoom accounts together. Do so.\n- [ ] Now make Zoom the default event location by editing each 'Event type' in Calendly (By default, there should be a `15 Minute Meeting`, `30 Minute Meeting` and `60 Minute Meeting` event types) by clicking the gear icon associated with each event type then going to `Edit`. Click on `What event is this?` and under `Location` choose Zoom. Click on `Save and Close`, and do this for each remaining event type.\n- [ ] [Set your working hours & availability](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/7638168?hl=en) in your Google Calendar.\n\n#### Events\n\nOn your calendar, you will have a invites to the below meetings, Please note: These meetings may not fall during your first week.\n\n1. Weekly planning sync. This is where the team reviews goals accomplished during the last week and picks up on what should be done this week to be successful.\n\n\n## Day 3 - Social\n\n\n### Social media + Expenses\n\n- [ ] Connect with or follow Dendron's social media sites:\n      [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dendron-so/),\n      [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dendronhq),\n      [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8GQLj4KZhN8WcJPiKXtcRQ).\n- [ ] Familiarize yourself with our [[expense report process|dendron.sop.expensing]] and bookmark the [link](https://airtable.com/shrtJd0sitnY6Bfre) to expensing stuff.\n\n\n* * *\n\n## Day 4 - Dendron + Github\n\nFor those new to Github and Dendron, it's important to get familiar with the below and [bookmark these links](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/self-service/)\n\n### General Breakdown\n\n1. [ ] Read how devs can [contribute](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/81da87be-2d4e-47b5-a1d6-c0d647e1ab00.html) to Dendron.\n2. [ ] Read [this page](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/3489b652-cd0e-4ac8-a734-08094dc043eb.html) and all child pages for an overview of the Dendron Development Process\n\n#### Issues and Issue Trackers\n\n- [ ] Learn how to use [Github Issues](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues). We use Github Issues to raise awareness, discuss, and propose solutions for various issues related to any aspect of our business. The most common issues are created in the following projects:\n   - [Dendron](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues) - Issues related to\n     our main tool.\n   - [Dendron Site](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-site/issues) - Issues related to documentation.\n- [ ] Make an improvement to the [handbook](https://github.com/dendronhq/handbook). Being new, you may be unsure if your idea for a change is good or not, and that's OK! Your pull request starts the discussion, so don't be afraid to offer your perspective as a new team member.\n   - [ ] Handbook: Assign the pull request (PR) to your onboarding buddy (if they have merge rights; if not, assign to your manager).\n\n### Survey\n- [ ] Set a reminder for 14 days past your start date to complete the [Onboarding Survey](https://airtable.com/shrcILcL6cm6lpCZt). We're actively trying to improve this process so please be proactive in reporting issues (or fixing them).\n\n## Job-specific tasks\n\n* [[Engineering|handbook.people.onboarding.engineering]]\n* [[Content|handbook.people.onboarding.content]]\n\n## Concepts\n\n### 2FA\n\nYou sign in with something you know (your password) and something you have (a code you can copy from your Virtual Multi-Factor authentication Device, like [Authy](https://authy.com), FreeOTP, or Google Authenticator).

When changes are ready to be reviewed, submit a pull request against `master`. \n\nFor feature branches, we use the following conventions:\n- feat/{feature-name}\n- fix/{fix-name}\n\n### Commit Style\n- we follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) with the following tags\n- categories:\n  - feat: feature - introduce new functionality\n  - enhance: enhancement - improve existing functionality\n  - fix: make something not broken\n  - chore: backend improvements\n  - spike: not complete commit\n \nIf you are introducing a breaking change, either add an `!` after the category or a footer at the end of your message\n\n```\nfeat: allow provided config object to extend other configs\n\nBREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config files\n```\n> Example from [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) licensed under [CC BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)\n\n```\nrefactor!: drop support for Node 6\n```\n> Example from [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) licensed under [CC BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)\n\n### Pre-Requisites\n\n1. Make sure there's a [[test|dev.process.qa#writing-tests]] for the new feature\n1. Make sure all the existing [[tests|dev.process.qa#running-all-tests]] pass \n1. Do a spot check by running your feature with our [[test Workspace|dev.process.qa#test-workspace]]\n1. If your change reflects documentation changes, also submit a PR to [dendron-site](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-site) and mention the doc PR link in your current PR\n\n\n### Creating a pull request\n\nBecause we do weekly releases, we like to do a weekly cadence for pull requests as well. Pull requests for next week's release should be in EOD Thursday ([your timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20210625T115900&p1=tz_aoe&p2=234&p3=64&p4=805&p5=102)).\n\nThe naming convention for a pull request is similar to that of a commit and takes the format `{category}: {description}`\n\n```\nfeat: Dendron can now pass the Turing test\n```\n\nIf your feature is not yet ready, you are encouraged to submit a pull request but mark it as a draft. This lets others comment on the design. If you're part of the core team, this is the standard practice for weekly deliverables.\n\nIf its your first pull request to Dendron, watch out for the [CLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) bot that will ask you to agree to Dendron's CLA\n\nIf its your first pull request and you're on our Discord, make sure that Kevin gives you the [[horticulturalist|community.roles#horticulturalist]] role  👨‍🌾👩‍🌾\n\nAfter you submit your pull request, check the output of our [integration test](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/actions) and make sure all tests pass\n\nOptionally, ping `@Dendron Team` in the `#dev` channel of our [discord](https://discord.gg/AE3NRw9) - we usually respond to PRs within 24h\n\n\n### Merging Changes\n\nOnce your feature request has been approved, it will most likely be merged by the person that is reviewing your code. We do a release every Monday which is also when you should expect your feature to be shipped. We also do an early seed release Thursdays/Fridays. If your changes are in before then, they can also be shipped along side the early seed\n\n## Checklist\n\n- Pre-Requisites\n\t- [ ] create a new branch according to our branching convention\n\t- [ ] implement feature/fix\n\t- [ ] write test\n\t- [ ] check existing tests pass\n\t- [ ] submit documentation pr if relevant\n- Creating a pull request (first time)\n\t- [ ] sign the CLA\n\t- [ ] ping Kevin about the `horticulturalist` role\n- Creating a pull request \n\t- [ ] make sure integration tests pass\n","n":0.043}}},{"i":36,"$":{"0":{"v":"Feedback","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n## Summary\n<!-- What is this SOP about -->\nHow we give feedback at Dendron\n\n## Prerequisites\n1.

Identify what part of the codebase is relevant to the feature you are working on.\n1. Try a quick `lookup` on the feature in this workspace and see if any note can give you the information you need.\n    - Specific features of Dendron will usually be described in `dendron.topic.*`\n    - Project related notes will be under `pro.*`\n1. Adding breakpoints and running the extension to just look into what is going on under the hood is also a good way to get a rough idea of what should be done.\n    - See [[Debugging Tests|dev.process.qa.debug]] for more information on how to do this.\n1. If this is not enough, consider asking for help (see below).\n\n## Asking for help\n\nIf troubleshooting yourself was not sufficient, you can seek help from other people in various places.\n\n1. Try asking specific questions in the `#dev` channel or `#dendron-team` channel of our Discord server.\n    - `#dev` is a public channel so your questions could get more exposure to people.\n    - An added bonus to preferring discussions in the `#dev` channel over private channels or DM is that other people (especially community members) can see this and use it as a reference if they decided to contribute in the future.\n\n1. If the issue isn't resolved yet, consider scheduling a pairing session with Kevin or anyone who has had prior experience working on the subject matter.\n    - Team members will have set up their calendars according to [[this guideline|templates.people.onboarding#calendar]] \n    - They will usually have available schedules listed in their user hierarchy (`user.{name}`). Otherwise, ping them or DM to find the best time.\n        - Kevin's calendar can be found [[here|dendron://private/user.kevin.ref.cal]], for example.\n\n1. If you have already started writing code, another good thing to do is to open a draft pull request on Github and pushing the progress you have made so far.\n    - This way other people can comment directly on your changes, and possibly work out the kinks asynchronously without you having to schedule a real time pairing session.\n\n## After getting help\n\n- To transform the troubleshooting efforts you have gone through into a permanent piece of knowledge, consider improving the existing documentation or add a new entry to our documentation with your findings.\n- This will make a positive feedback loop of improved documentations and easier troubleshooting for yourself and others in the future.\n","n":0.045}}},{"i":38,"$":{"0":{"v":"Daily Journal","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n\n## Summary\n<!-- What is this SOP about -->\n\nDaily journals are how we do standup.

Get permission to join the github workspace (you should get a notification on Github when this is ready)\n1. Go throught the Dendron Tutorial. When you install Dendron for the first time, you will be taken through a tutorial that walks you over the basics. If you missed it, you can bring it up again by bringing up the [[Command Prompt|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron._ref.command-prompt]] and typing `Dendron: Launch Tutorial`\n    - IMPORTANT: do this before proceeding. \n\n### Steps\n\n#### Setting Up Your Workspace \n1. Clone the Dendron private workspace \n    ```sh\n    git clone git@github.com:dendronhq/org-workspace.git\n    ```\n\n    - NOTE: If you are onboarding via our trial, please use the following command \n\n    ```sh\n    git clone ssh://github.com/dendronhq/org-workspace-incubator\n    ```\n\n1. Open up your Dendron workspace\n    - NOTE: we're using `code-insider` CLI in this example but this will vary depending on what VSCode client you use\n    ```sh\n    cd {workspace}\n    code-insider .\n    ```\n1. You will see a prompt to `Open workspace file` on the bottom right corner. Click on the prompt\n1. Wait ~30s for your workspace to initialize. Dendron is initializing your workspace and downloading company documents at this point\n1. After your workspace is finished initializing, you should have a workspace with the following vaults (your workspace might look different depending if you are full time or still in the trial period)\n![[handbook.map#vaults,1:#*]]\n\n#### Start individual onboarding\n1. Your manager should already have setup a hierarchy for you. You can find it by going to `user.{YOUR_ALIAS}`\n1. Go to `user.{YOUR_ALIAS}.onboarding` where you should have a copy of our [[Onboarding checklist|templates.people.onboarding]] to walk you through the rest of the process\n\n<!-- #### Go Over Company Values\n1.  Take a moment to read the `handbook.company*` notes. Especially the following sections:\n  - [[Mission|handbook.company.mission]]\n  - [[Values|handbook.company.values]]\n  - [[handbook.company.key-principles]]\n\n#### Get Context on whats been happening\n1. Read up on company [[schemas|handbook.map#schemas]] to understand how to navigate the workspace\n1. Look at [[Projects|schemas.proj]] to see what the current month's initiatives are as well as whats coming up\n1. Review the [[Weekly|schemas.weekly]] notes to see progress we've made over the past few weeks (you can go all the way back to week 1)\n1.

This means learning from past mistakes and building on top of what has come before.\n\nWe take best practices from the places we admire and adapt them for current realities. When implementing new functionality, instead of *not invented here*, we look to  *build on what already exists*.\n\nThis is not a one-off process but something that we work at each and every day.\n\n## 80/20\n\nIn many situations, 20% of the work accounts for 80% of the output.  This is also known as the [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle). \n\nThis could be finding a *good enough solution* for an intractable problem or refining a document down to just the key points - we focus on doing work that has the highest impact.\n\n## Iterate\n\nThe perfect is the enemy of the shipped. We strive to do great work but we will do it incrementally instead of waiting for something to be _perfect_. We prioritize ruthlessly, delivering the right things with the right quality in a timely fashion.\n\nIteration means that we will hit the deadline but are flexible about the scope.

Our north star is meaningfully improving the lives of everyone who uses Dendron. \n\nThis means listening closely to what our users have to say, making sure eveyrone can have a voice, and making decisions based on whether it will be beneficial for our users.\n\n## Pass it Forward\n\nWe aim to leave things in a better state than when we found it. Whether that's code, documentation, best practices, or personal development, we strive to continuously improve the things that we see.\n\nThis means creating [[standard operating procedures|handbook.sop]] to spread best practices, documenting things so that others can find them, and continuously drive change to make existing things better. \n\nThis also means working in the open so that everyone can benefit from our learnings - Dendron is built on the work that has come before us and we like to make it possible for others to build upon the work that we do. \n\n## Keep no False Idols\n\nThe only constant in the universe is change. As we establish best practices and ways of doing it, we need to remember that at the end of the day, things change and what might have worked yesterday might no longer be relevant today.\n\nThis means that while we  ways of doing things, those ways can change and *because we've always done it this way* is never a good justification for not considering changing. \n\n\n\n<!-- ### In Practice\n\n- We provide personal onboardings for new users\n- We addressing questions and feedback in [discord](https://discord.gg/AE3NRw9) in near realtime\n- We adjusting and prioritize user feedback when planning our [roadmap](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6e4c4f61-80a3-46fa-9ad3-04b99d9e9695.html)\n- We err on the side of over communicating when we're not sure if our message is understood -->\n\n<!-- - We dedicate a `learnings` section to the end of every project to figure out how to improve the process for next time -->\n\n<!-- ## Sustainability\n\nWe look for virtuous cycles and long term growth in what we do. This means we think about the long term **costs and benefits** of what we do, features we ship, and promises that we make.\n\nWhether its code, tooling our community - our goal is to leave things in a better state than how we found it.  -->\n\n\n<!-- ### Key Principles\n\n#### Pragmatism\n\nWe have high level goals but we are flexible in the details. At the end of the day we will do whatever it takes to help people make sense of the things that matter.  We look to integrate with existing tools instead of replacing them using pods and interoperable standards\n\n## Bias for Action\n\n> Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking. \n\n> Amazon Leadership Principle\n\n\n## Working in the Open\n\nThis means that we will be transaparent about what, how, and why we do things. \n\n### In Practice\n\n- We released Dendron as an open source product\n- We published our handbook for everyone to see\n- We publish our [roadmap](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6e4c4f61-80a3-46fa-9ad3-04b99d9e9695.html) on github\n\n\n### In Practice\n- All important decisions and learnings are written down in the company handbook so everyone can benefit\n- We are collecting and indexing the worlds data in publically available vaults on [Personal Knowledge Management](https://pkm.dendron.so/), [AWS](https://aws.dendron.so/) and of course [XKCD](https://xkcd.dendron.so/)\n- We would rather scope down or postpone work than do work that is unsustainable (eg. extended long hours, significant tech debt or operational cost, etc)\n\n### Key Principles\n\n#### Systems First\n\nWhile we generally trust that people will try to do the right thing, humans make mistakes. Its part of being human. Therefore, we aim to build automated processes and systems for common and complicated issues. \n\nIn Practice:\n- Continuous Integration tests on all features\n- Checklists and SOPs for all processes\n\n#### Flywheels\n\nWe are looking to create systems that make make things easier\n\nIn Practice:\n- [[Learn and Adapt|handbook.company.values#learn-and-adapt]] -> [[Iterate|handbook.company.values#iteration]] -> [[Learn|handbook.company.values#lifelong-learning]]\n\n#### Bias for Simplicity\n\nThings should be as complicated as they need to be and no more. \n\nIn Practice:\n- When creating new features, opt for sensible defaults vs need for extra configuration\n\n#### Pruning\n\nComplexity happens when growth happens in absence of feedback. Pruning is about inventing and simplifying.  Whether its working on Dendron, internal processes or external documentation, the goal is not to simply add more features and functions but also consider how things are like as a whole\n\nIn Practice:\n- Dedicated [pruning](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/3be48b69-76e1-495e-9314-cae2fe22813d.html#pruning-️) section in changelog\n- Monthly review of internal processes and external docs for pruning opportunities\n\n\n<!-- ## Passing It Forward\n\nWe leave things better than we found it. Code, knowledge, the world - we like to leave things so that the next person coming back do it will have a better way of starting.\n\n### In Practice\n- all important decisions and learnings are written down in the company handbook so everyone can benefit\n- we are collecting and indexing the worlds data in publically available vaults on [Personal Knowledge Management](https://pkm.dendron.so/), [AWS](https://aws.dendron.so/) and of course [XKCD](https://xkcd.dendron.so/)\n --> \n","n":0.03}}},{"i":60,"$":{"0":{"v":"Mission","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nDendron helps **humans** organize, reference, and work with any amount of knowledge.\n\nWe provide an open-source, local-first, markdown-based note-taking tool that helps developers work with notes like they do with code.\n\nDendron borrows heavily from prior work in programming languages and developer tooling (which help developers organize and reference millions of lines of code) and applies the same principles to general knowledge.\n\nFrom day one, the words of Vannevar Bush, originator of the [memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex), has been our north star\n\n> \"We are overwhelmed with information and we don't have the tools to properly index and filter through it.

Having a single source of truth for everything we do helps us effectively communicate and build up institutional knowledge. This is the foundation that makes an async first, remote workplace culture possible and gives everyone a way to participate in the decision making process.\n\n### Over Communicate\n- Values\n    * [[Close the Loop|dendron://dendron.handbook/handbook.company.values#close-the-loop]]\n    * [[Community Focus|dendron://dendron.handbook/handbook.company.values#community-focus]]\n    * [[Iterate|dendron://dendron.handbook/handbook.company.values#iterate]]\n\nThings get lost in translation. Especially across timezones and across messaging apps. When in doubt, followup.\n\n### Examples\n- when you send out a PR and haven't received a response within 24h, ping the PR owner in case they've missed it\n- when you are writing documentation for some new process, make sure the rest of the team knows about it by scheduling an async\n- when you get a message, acknowledge reading the message via a response or a 👍\n- when you merge a github branch and have some outstanding comments, also ping the submitter\n\n\n\n<!-- #### No One Offs\n\nThere are some things that we will do exactly once. For everything else, we will make sure to document things so that others can build off our work. -->\n\n<!-- #### Dive Deep\n\n> Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them. - [Amazon Leadership Principle](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles)\n\n#### Earning Trust\n\nWe act and follow through on things that demonstrates trust.
