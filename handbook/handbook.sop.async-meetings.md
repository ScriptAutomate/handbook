## Summary
- stage: [[Seed|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/tags.stage.seed]]

At Dendron, we try to be async first. Async meetings let us collaborate across different timezones. This involves setting a date, inviting relevant parties, and having a shared gdoc that participants can comment on.

The purpose of these should be to encourage discussion, brainstorming, or decision making.

Examples of good use cases - going over a design doc, discussing product strategy, etc.


## Process
1. create a google doc
  - if you have a `@dendron.so` email address, create a gdoc by going to https://docs.google.com 
    - make sure to give the following people: team@dendron.so, trial@dendron.so
  - if you do not have a `dendron.so` email address, ping @kevin or @jonathan to create one for you
    - make sure to give the following people: team@dendron.so, trial@dendron.so
  - use the [[meeting template|dendron://dendron.handbook/templates.meet]] as the general outline for the meeting
1. create a calendar invite with the following:
  - Title: [async] "What you need done"
  - Guests: anyone who needs to get things done with you (but working separately)
  - Location: At your desk.
1. 24h after the meeting, copy the meeting notes back into the workspace under `meet.journal.{date}.{topic}`
1. ping relevant parties when the meeting is done
