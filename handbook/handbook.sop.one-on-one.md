## Summary 

One on one's are a chance to reflect on what's been done, go over blockers, and plan for the future. It is also a chance to talk about career goals and growth plans at Dendron.

The cadence for one on one's will depend on the individual and circumstance - in general, we'll do this 1x per week for the first month and then at a relaxed cadence afterwards. 

## Process

### Manager 
- for each direct report, create `[[user.$name.feedback]]` note inside the `admin` vault 
  - use this space to make notes for direct reports, noting areas of strength and areas for focus

### Direct Report
- before the one on one, team members are encouraged to fill out as much of the one-on-one template a day prior into google docs [^1]

### Meeting
- actual meeting is conducted over google doc [^1]

## Templates

This is a starting template for what a one on one typically looks like.
