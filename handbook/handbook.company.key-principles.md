## Summary

Key principles are building blocks for thinking about bigger values. A key principle can fit into multiple values.


### Key Principles

#### Documentation First

In order to build on what exists, we need to first bring it forth into existence with writing.

#### No One Offs

There are very few things that we will do exactly once. For everything else, we will make sure to document things so that others can build off our work.

#### Dive Deep

> Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them. - [Amazon Leadership Principle](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles)

#### Earning Trust

We act and follow through on things that demonstrates trust. This includes little things like showing up for meetings ahead of time to big things like honoring the commitments we make - whether that be from a chat dialogue or an official announcement.


#### Deliver Results

> Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle. - [Amazon Leadership Principle](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles)
