## Summary
This goes over how and why we do a regular _**pruning and repotting**_ session in our organization.

## What is it?

> :bulb: "To gain knowledge, add things every day; to gain wisdom, subtract things every day." - Lao Tzu

- A _**pruning and repotting session**_ is a monthly session to go through everything a Dendron team member added to org-workspace to keep the workspace in order and prioritize our goals.
- We _**prune out**_ notes and ideas in order to promote new growth.
- We _**repot**_ ideas that have grown out of their existing shells to a suitable location where they could thrive.

## Why do we do it?
### 1. Decluttering of the workspace
- **The value of a note diminishes over time** if it cannot be effectively utilized and looked up.
- Removing stale notes and/or refactoring them into a permanent, meaningful piece of information elsewhere is necessary for healthy growth.
    - For Dendron as an organization, the ideal expected outcome of this should be an **actionable project** or an **idea that could be germinated into a future project**.

#### 1.1 Scratch notes
- Scratch notes are a good way to capture the immediacy of ideas but _have little meaning without the context_ in which the scratch notes were created.
- Old scratch notes lose their meaning as time goes by, even if they contain valid and useful information.
    - This is because old scratch notes lose their context as we forget about them, unless we find a proper hierarchy for (or get rid of) them.

> :warning: Having a lot of scratch notes is not by itself a bad idea. If by capturing an idea quickly in a larger context of a different note it has served it's purpose, **there is no need to repot them**. That being said, since scratch notes will most likely be relevant when presented with the accompanying context, it might _introduce noise in a different view_ (e.g. graph view or tree view) where the context is hard to see or is not present. In this case, it is worth **filtering them out** from those affected views.

#### 1.2 Journal notes
- Journal notes are great for organizing tasks and goals in a temporal manner, but as items carry over it creates a lot of duplicates.
- Similar to scratch notes, a massive trail of journal notes provide little to no utility as it becomes older and lose it's context.

> :warning: Consider keeping journal notes as is and not repotting them into another note. By definition, a journal note should capture what happened at a particular point of time. Try to **extract insights** from past journal notes and **fix obvious errors** in them, but keep the general content of the notes intact.

> :warning: Similar to scratch notes, journal notes can potentially introduce noise in other views such as the graph view or tree view. Consider **archiving** them somewhere else once you have extracted meaningful insights from them or if you are certain that you won't be looking them up regularly.

### 2. Retrospection
- Simply writing notes is not enough to cultivate a lively workspace; it is crucial that we carefully observe how our notes grow in order to learn and adapt.
- This goes for the actual content of the notes itself, but also the meta structure of the notes as well.
- Having a pruning session regularly **gives us a chance to look at how our ideas and note grew over time** and iterate on what we did well and what we didn't.

> _**Wouldn't it be better to do retrospection on a project basis?**_
> - Retrospects are a good way to evaluate what has been done well or otherwise.
    - For _mission critical_ matters, consider doing a retrospect _immediately_ after the incident has been resolved.
> - However, it's not clear how often we should do this, and on what basis we should do this (i.e., _appropriate granularity_ and _cadence_ is unclear).
    - By lumping retrospection into a monthly event, we can _ignore the headache of figuring out an appropriate granularity_.
    - The _cadence_ in which we run a pruning / repotting session can be _adjusted based on our needs_.
> - _Impromptu retrospects are hard_ to do with a fully-remote team, and _sporadic retrospects will inevitably cause context switches at unexpected times_ for participants.
    - With scheduled sessions, one could prepare asynchronously _ahead of time_ and also have a _reasonable expectation_ of what work has to be done beforehand.

### 3. Serendipity
- Beneath the overgrown vines there could be a hidden budding flower or a fruit that is waiting to be discovered.
- With notes added to the workspace each day, one's brilliant idea could get buried in the multitude of other notes.
- Regularly pruning out the notes gives us **a chance to make unexpected discoveries of great ideas** that were hidden.
    - We can then turn these into projects and figure out actionable tasks (repotting).

## How we do it
On the last week of every calendar month, do the following:

> Depending on the topics / candidates we want to focus on for the session, there might be more specific instructions given by the host to the team for the async preparation before the meeting. Use the information below as general guidance and follow the specific instructions given by the session host.

- _**Before we meet**_
    1. **(session host)** The session host goes over the existing notes and compiles a list of notes/hierarchies that should be pruned and repotted for this month.
        - Fill up the `Candidates` section of [[templates.repot]]
        - The session host need not go through the actual content of all the candidates; simply grab the filenames of each note added to the workspace in the last month.
        - Even if it's not something added this month, it could be useful to add as a candidate.
            - Try using the graph view  to see which part of the workspace is crowded and requires some organizing using the best of your judgement.
        - If there are specific instructions on that month's session, let them know when you announce the list of candidates.
    1. **(attendee)** Create a repotting note in `user.{name}.repot.{yyyy}.{mm}.{dd}` and log what needs to be pruned or repotted from the aforementioned candidate list.
        - Simply marking each note with what needs to be done would be sufficient, but adding some reasoning behind it would speed up the process when we meet up and discuss.
        - For items that need repotting, try to comment on how they should be repotted. (e.g. notes `A`, `B`, and `C` have information that could be combined to start project `D`.)
        - If there are specific instructions particular to that session, the host will let you know.
- _**During the session**_
    1. **(session host)** Share your screen with everyone's repot notes and go over items.
        - Consider consolidating everyone's repot note into one note for the sake of simplifying the session.
    1. Share your pruning/repotting note with the team.
    1. Review ideas that need pruning and assign owner(s) to prune them.
        - **(session host)** Assign a single master gardener (or yourself) for this task since pruning asynchronously will eventually cause merge conflicts.
    1. Review repot ideas and assign a gardener.
        - Bounce around ideas on each item during the session so that the person who has been assigned to the repotting task can work on it more easily.
        - **(session host)** Make sure to take notes on the discussions made and who is being assigned to the repotting tasks.
    1. Do a short retrospection on the things we achieved during the month and how we can structure our knowledge better.
        - Don't forget to also go over the _wins_ of how we are structuring the notes already.
- _**After the session**_
    1. Check what pruning / repotting tasks you have been assigned.
    1. Work on pruning / repotting them.
        - For pruning, remove or archive notes according to the [[The 4D's of pruning|dendron.sop.pruning-and-repotting#the-4ds-of-pruning]]
        - Note that the person who repots an idea does not necessarily need to own the project / task, but the end result of a repotting should be a `proj.*` item that someone can pick up and start working immediately.
        - If a certain item cannot be immediately actionable, add it to the [[sprouting jar|sprouting-jar]] so that when the time comes it can be turned into a **proj**ect.
    1. Let people know it has been done.

## Principles

### The 4D's of pruning
1. **Dead**
    - These are notes/ideas that used to have a purpose, but have lost their immediate purpose.
    
    > e.g.) 
    - You have created a note containing documentation for a feature X in the past, but this has become obsolete. This note is considered `Dead`
    - If this note is not linked in a broader context, you can safely remove this note.

1. **Diseased**
    - Notes that are incomplete / not tended well / contain wrong information.

    > e.g.) 
    - You have partially created a note to document something. At some point, you have moved onto a new note and finished off the documentation there. Both contain similar content, but one is incomplete. This note is considered `diseased`, and you can safely remove the partial note and correctly link the complete one.
    - You have created a note that turns out to be misleading or wrong. If this note is something that will be potentially looked up later, you can fix the errors. Otherwise, it is safe to delete it.

1. **Damaged**
    - Notes with syntax errors, or malformed frontmatter, missing links, etc.

    > e.g.) 
    - You have a syntax error in the frontmatter (like a trailing comma after a variable)
    - You have a note that has one less or one extra square bracket for a wikilink. This will cause some problems with parsing later on and should be fixed.

1. **Deranged**
    - These are notes/ideas that contain useful information but are placed in an ill-defined location or otherwise hidden.
    - It may be structured in a way that can't be immediately useful for anyone.
    - Somehow the note/idea is incomplete or out of context.
    - Notes that are obstructed by other content or are obstructing other notes.

    > e.g.) 
    - You were in a pinch, so you copy-pasted a long stack trace inside your journal note at some point rather than dumping them in a scratch note. This could obstruct the meaningful content in that journal note and should be removed or refactored into a separate note.
    - You had a Eureka moment and jotted down an idea to make Dendron even better. However, you were in a meeting and this idea was written in your meeting notes. This should be repotted to a place where you keep your ideas, or turned into a `proj.*` item.
