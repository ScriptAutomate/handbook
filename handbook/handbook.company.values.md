## Summary

This page describes our values as a company. 

## Transparency

We work in the open. This means that we will be transaparent about what, how, and why we do things. 

### In Practice
- We released Dendron as an open source product
- We published our handbook for everyone to see
- We publish our [roadmap](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6e4c4f61-80a3-46fa-9ad3-04b99d9e9695.html) on github 

## Customer Obsession

Dendron wouldn't exist without its users. At the end of the day, the way we think about what to work on is guided by what would be best for our users.

### In Practice
- We provide personal onboardings for new users
- We addressing questions and feedback in [discord](https://discord.gg/AE3NRw9) in near realtime
- We adjusting and prioritize user feedback when planning our [roadmap](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6e4c4f61-80a3-46fa-9ad3-04b99d9e9695.html)

## Iteration

The perfect is the enemy of the shipped. We strive to do great work but we will do it incrementally instead of waiting for something to be *perfect*.

### In Practice
- We publish our work (eg. code, handbook, roadmap) in the process of working on it
- We push out updates on a [weekly release cycle](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/932534e7-e788-4fdb-bc8c-eaf761992a8d.html)
- We dedicate a `learnings` section to the end of every project to figure out how to improve the process for next time
