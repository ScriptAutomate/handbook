## Summary

This page describes our values as a company. 

## Transparency

We work in the open. This means that we will be transaparent about what, how, and why we do things. 

### In Practice
- Our code is open source
- Our handbook is available online
- Unless there is good cause, we will make everything we're working on transparent to both our community and our workers


## Iteration

The perfect is the enemy of the shipped. We strive to do great work but we will do it incrementally instead of waiting for something to be *perfect*.

### In Practice
- We will be transparent about our work as we're working on it (eg. Code, Handbook, Roadmap, etc)
- We have [weekly release cycles](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/932534e7-e788-4fdb-bc8c-eaf761992a8d.html)
