## Summary

This page describes our values as a company. We are at our best when we operate with these values in mind.

## Community Focused

Dendron wouldn't exist without our strong community. Our north star is meaningfully improving the lives of everyone who uses Dendron. The way we think about what to work on is guided by what would be best for our entire community. 

When we say community, we mean **everyone** who participates in Dendron: both our users and our team. 

<!--  This still needs more clarification
### Key Principles

#### Do What is Best for the User

#### Focus on the Team 
When doing work 
-->

### In Practice

- We provide personal onboardings for new users
- We addressing questions and feedback in [discord](https://discord.gg/AE3NRw9) in near realtime
- We adjusting and prioritize user feedback when planning our [roadmap](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6e4c4f61-80a3-46fa-9ad3-04b99d9e9695.html)

## Lookup

Instead of _not invented here_, we believe in _building on what already exists_. We actively seek to find order in the universe and add our node on top of what already exists. This means keeping our own knowledge organized so its easier for others to re-use as well as considering existing solutions before implementing our own thing. 

### In Practice

- we use standard markdown where possible and expand where needed, with a focus on interoperability and portability
- we based our values off our experience in past companies as well as places we admire

### Key Principles

#### Documentation First

In order to build on what exists, we need to first bring it forth into existence with writing.

#### No One Offs

There are very few things that we will do exactly once. For everything else, we will make sure to document things so that others can build off our work.

## Pragmatism

We have high level goals but we are flexible in the details. At the end of the day we will do whatever it takes to help people make sense of the things that matter.

### In Practice
- We build Dendron on top of VSCode because it has widespread adoption and allows us to iterate quickly
- We look to integrate with existing tools instead of replacing them using pods and interoperable standards

## Ownership

We care about putting high quality, well thought through products out to customers. True artisans view products end-to-end and never sacrifice long-term reputational value for short-term results. We act on behalf of the entire team and community, beyond just our own focus area. We are not satisfied by the phrase “that’s not my job.”

### In Practice

- We prioritize entire customer scenarios over component areas

### Key Principles

#### Closing the Loop

Whether we are working on features or improving processes, the job isn't done until value has been delivered. That means shipping the feature isn't enough - our users need to be able to adopt and get value from said feature in the daily workflow. SOPs aren't considered done until the team and the community are able to successfully adopt them. 

## Transparency

We work in the open. This means that we will be transaparent about what, how, and why we do things.

### In Practice

- We released Dendron as an open source product
- We published our handbook for everyone to see
- We publish our [roadmap](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6e4c4f61-80a3-46fa-9ad3-04b99d9e9695.html) on github

## Iteration

The perfect is the enemy of the shipped. We strive to do great work but we will do it incrementally instead of waiting for something to be _perfect_. We prioritize ruthlessly, delivering the right things with the right quality in a timely fashion.

Iteration means that we will hit the deadline but are flexible about the scope. It's okay and also encouraged to have multiple phases for any individual feature.

### In Practice

- We publish our work (eg. code, handbook, roadmap) in the process of working on it
- We push out updates on a [weekly release cycle](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/932534e7-e788-4fdb-bc8c-eaf761992a8d.html)
<!-- - We dedicate a `learnings` section to the end of every project to figure out how to improve the process for next time -->

## Sustainability

We look for virtuous cycles and long term growth in all that we do. This means we think about both the long term **benefits and costs** of the actions we take and invest in areas that will take many years to bear fruit. It also means we don't do things as a one off and try to find ways to re-use existing work. 

We leave things better than we found it. Code, knowledge, the world - we like to leave things so that the next person coming back do it will have a better way of starting.

### In Practice
- All important decisions and learnings are written down in the company handbook so everyone can benefit
- We are collecting and indexing the worlds data in publically available vaults on [Personal Knowledge Management](https://pkm.dendron.so/), [AWS](https://aws.dendron.so/) and of course [XKCD](https://xkcd.dendron.so/)
- We would rather scope down or postpone work than do work that is unsustainable (eg. extended long hours, significant tech debt or operational cost, etc)

### Key Principles

#### Systems First

While we generally trust that people will try to do the right thing, humans make mistakes. Its part of being human. Therefore, we aim to build automated processes and systems for common and complicated issues. 

In Practice:
- Continuous Integration tests on all features
- Checklists and SOPs for all processes

#### Flywheels

We are looking to create systems that make make things easier

In Practice:
- [[Lookup|handbook.company.values#lookup]] -> [[Iterate|handbook.company.values#iteration]] -> [[Learn|handbook.company.values#lifelong-learning]]

#### Bias for Simplicity

Things should be as complicated as they need to be and no more. 

In Practice:
- When creating new features, opt for sensible defaults vs need for extra configuration

#### Pruning

Complexity happens when growth happens in absence of feedback. Pruning is about inventing and simplifying.  Whether its working on Dendron, internal processes or external documentation, the goal is not to simply add more features and functions but also consider how things are like as a whole

In Practice:
- Dedicated [pruning](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/3be48b69-76e1-495e-9314-cae2fe22813d.html#pruning-️) section in changelog
- Monthly review of internal processes and external docs for pruning opportunities


<!-- ## Passing It Forward

We leave things better than we found it. Code, knowledge, the world - we like to leave things so that the next person coming back do it will have a better way of starting.

### In Practice
- all important decisions and learnings are written down in the company handbook so everyone can benefit
- we are collecting and indexing the worlds data in publically available vaults on [Personal Knowledge Management](https://pkm.dendron.so/), [AWS](https://aws.dendron.so/) and of course [XKCD](https://xkcd.dendron.so/)
