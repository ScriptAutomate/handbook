## Summary

This page describes our values as a company. We are at our best when we operate with these values in mind.

## Lookup

Instead of _not invented here_, we believe in _building on what already exists_. We actively seek to find order in the universe and add our node on top of what already exists.

### In Practice

- we use standard markdown where possible and expand where needed, with a focus on interoperability and portability
- we based our values off our experience in past companies as well as places we admire

## Pragmatism

We have high level goals but we are flexible in the details. At the end of the day we will do whatever it takes to help people make sense of the things that matter.

### In Practice
- We build Dendron on top of VSCode because it has widespread adoption and allows us to iterate quickly
- We look to integrate with existing tools instead of replacing them using pods and interoperable standards

## Community Focused

Dendron wouldn't exist without our strong community. Our north star is meaningfully improving the lives of everyone who uses Dendron. The way we think about what to work on is guided by what would be best for our entire community.

### In Practice

- We provide personal onboardings for new users
- We addressing questions and feedback in [discord](https://discord.gg/AE3NRw9) in near realtime
- We adjusting and prioritize user feedback when planning our [roadmap](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6e4c4f61-80a3-46fa-9ad3-04b99d9e9695.html)

## Ownership

We care about putting high quality, well thought through products out to customers. True artisans view products end-to-end and never sacrifice long-term reputational value for short-term results. We act on behalf of the entire team and community, beyond just our own focus area. We are not satisfied by the phrase “that’s not my job.”

### In Practice

- We prioritize entire customer scenarios over component areas.

## Lifelong Learning

We are never done learning (we are in the knowledge management space after all ...) and we always seek to improve ourselves. We are externally curious, internally aware and seek to explore.

### In Practice

- We are collecting and indexing the worlds data in publically available vaults on [Personal Knowledge Management](https://pkm.dendron.so/), [AWS](https://aws.dendron.so/) and of course [XKCD](https://xkcd.dendron.so/)

## Transparency

We work in the open. This means that we will be transaparent about what, how, and why we do things.

### In Practice

- We released Dendron as an open source product
- We published our handbook for everyone to see
- We publish our [roadmap](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6e4c4f61-80a3-46fa-9ad3-04b99d9e9695.html) on github

## Iteration

The perfect is the enemy of the shipped. We strive to do great work but we will do it incrementally instead of waiting for something to be _perfect_. We prioritize ruthlessly, delivering the right things with the right quality in a timely fashion.

Iteration means that we will hit the deadline but are fleixble about the scope. It's okay and also encouraged to have multiple phases for any individual feature. 

### In Practice

- We publish our work (eg. code, handbook, roadmap) in the process of working on it
- We push out updates on a [weekly release cycle](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/932534e7-e788-4fdb-bc8c-eaf761992a8d.html)
- We dedicate a `learnings` section to the end of every project to figure out how to improve the process for next time

## Productivity

We like to be efficient about how we do things. This could mean finding better tools and processes to do things as well as finding the [right things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) to work on in the first place. Life is short - we aim to make good use of the time that we have. 

### In Practice
- [[Lookup|handbook.company.values#lookup]] -> [[Iterate|handbook.company.values#iteration]] -> [[Learn|handbook.company.values#lifelong-learning]]
- We show up ahead of time for meetings - whether we are onboarding a new customer or meeting internally, we respect people's time and will not keep people waiting
