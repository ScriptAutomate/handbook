## Summary 

One on one's are a chance to reflect on what's been done, go over blockers, and plan for the future. It is also a chance to talk about career goals and growth plans at Dendron.

The cadence for one on one's will depend on the individual and circumstance - in general, we'll do this 1x per week for the first month and then at a relaxed cadence afterwards. 

## Template

This is a starting template for what a one on one typically looks like.

## Process

Before the one on one, team members are encouraged to fill out as much of the one-on-one template a day prior to help prepare both parties for the meeting.

If you feel comfortable sharing these notes with the company, you can add them in the `private` vault. Otherwise, you can email them to the respective parties or message them over Discord.
