## Perks

- we are an open source company, you get credit for your work
- we are a remote first company (the founders are in two different continents) which means you get to work where ever you can find an internet connection
- we offer real salaries, benefits and meaningful equity
- we believe knowledge and personal growth is a key differentiator and will reimburse you for any books you'd like to buy (though we do ask for you to share the wealth and leave some cliff notes in our company workspace at [[books]])
- remote companies have serious fun! We do game nights (with a rotating list of games) and you can always expense games we play together.
- we have a learning budget of $1500/person/year that can be applied to anything to help you grow and develop
