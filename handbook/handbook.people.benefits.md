## Perks

- we are an open source company, you get credit for your work
  - [[Working in the Open|handbook.company.values#working-in-the-open]] is one of our key principals which means that you get to reference the full details of your work anywhere you go
- we are a remote first company which means you get to work where ever you can find an internet connection
  - we focus on [[written|handbook.company.values#documentation-first]] async communication to make this work - you'll probably have around 2h of synchronous meetings in any given week
- we believe in being generous with equity and have a seven year excise window instead of the industry standard 90 days
  - you can read more about the benefits [here](https://dangelo.quora.com/10-Year-Exercise-Periods-Make-Sense) and [here](https://cs.stanford.edu/~rishig/90-day-exercise-windows.html)
- we are strong supporters of personal growth
  - we have a learning budget of $1500/person/year that can be applied to anything to help you grow and develop 
- we like books
  - we will reimburse you for any books you'd like to buy (we do ask for you to share the wealth and leave some cliff notes in our company workspace so everyone can benefit)
- we believe in team building 
  - we do game nights (with a rotating list of games), remote meals and other virtual events to get together outside of the work context
