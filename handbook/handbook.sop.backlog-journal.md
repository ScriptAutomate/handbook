## Summary

The backlog journal is where we track items that fall outsidie of scope for the day or the week

## Process

Backlog items are tracked in `user.{name}.backlog`.

If you find items being carried over week after week in your [[weekly Journal|handbook.sop.weekly-journal]], consider moving it to the backlog. 

This is also a good place to queue up upcoming projects that you'll be working on this month/quarter.
