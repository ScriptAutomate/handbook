## Process

### Creating a new SOP
When a SOP is first created, make sure to send a pull request to the right audience (eg. usually either the team or the community at large). If a SOP is sent to the team, it is not done until it has been merged and everyone has checked off reading it in their [[daily journal|handbook.sop.daily-journal]]. It is the job of the SOP author to make sure this is done

### Updating an existing SOP
