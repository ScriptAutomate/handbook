## Summary
<!-- What is this SOP about -->

Daily journals are how we do standup. Instead of doing a synchronous daily meeting, we communicate via asynchronous journal notes.

## Process
1. At the end of the workday, create a daily journal note for the next day `user.{username}.journal.{date}` using the standup [^standup] template
    - at this time, also close of and update all tasks that you have worked on for the current day
    - NOTE: for the weekend, make sure that the journal note for Monday is ready on Friday

## Templates
- Standup [^standup]
