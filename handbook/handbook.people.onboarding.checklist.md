## Welcome to Dendron!

We are so excited youâ€™re here and look forward to setting you up for [all-remote](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/guide/) success as your journey begins. Copy this onboarding checklist and work through them over the course of your first 30 days. If any task doesn't make sense, please reach out to the team on discord. **Note:** We [lookup](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/b89ba854-72fb-4ebc-a8a0-55960b89e9dc.html#lookup) to Gitlab for their focus on [single-source of truth](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#single-source-of-truth) handbook creation and would like to do the same for Dendron. We've included a lot of links to the Gitlab handbook and will tweak/subsume them into the Dendron handbook over time. The wealth of information in this note can be overwhelming at times. It's okay to skim through resources, bookmark them and come back at a later time.

### Introduction

This is your core onboarding issue and it is housed in Dendron in the interests of what is known as [dogfooding](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#dogfooding). It has been crafted with the [three dimensions of remote onboarding](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/onboarding/) in mind, namely: Organizational Onboarding, Technical Onboarding and Social Onboarding.

All three of these are underpinned by the sentiments of [lifelong learning](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/b89ba854-72fb-4ebc-a8a0-55960b89e9dc.html#lifelong-learning), while encouraging [asynchronous communication and workflows](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/).

### Support and our Single Source of Truth

Since Dendron aspires to be a [handbook first](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/) organization, the answer to question you may have particularly throughout your first thirty days should be documented and readily available in the [handbook](http://handbook.dendron.so). If you are unable to find the information you are looking for, please reach out on the #dendron-team channel in Discord and update the handbook once you find the answer.

### The First Thirty Days

This issue consists of a series of tasks which should be completed sequentially over the course of the next thirty days structured as follows:

<!--TODO: Modify this -->>

| Day         | Area of Focus                                |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Day 01**  | Accounts; Applications and Paperwork         |
| **Day 02**  | Remote Work; Communication and Values        |
| **Day 03**  | Organizational Structure and Social Elements |
| **Day 04**  | Introduction to Dendron and using Github     |
| **Day 05+** | Explore (Various)                            |

Though you may be eager to jump right into your role we encourage you to set aside dedicated time every day for your first week to focus on these tasks as they are geared toward ensuring you are enabled to [thrive in an all-remote environment](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/onboarding/#the-importance-of-onboarding).

### Continuous Improvement

In the interests of paying it forward and contributing to our core value of [Iteration](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/b89ba854-72fb-4ebc-a8a0-55960b89e9dc.html#iteration) - we encourage you to suggest changes and updates to this note and the handbook, both of which can be done via Pull Request (PR).

Along with this you will complete onboarding on Day Thirty by being asked to fill out the [Onboarding Satisfaction Survey](TODO), which is an opportunity to share feedback on your general Onboarding Experience.

</details>

### Day 1 - Getting Started: Accounts and Paperwork

<details>
<summary>New Team Member</summary>

#### 1Password

1. [ ] :red_circle: Install 1Password. Dendron provides all team members with an account to 1Password. Some teams use 1Password for shared notes and some shared accounts. 1Password is available as a standalone application for macOS, and as a browser extension and CLI tool for Linux.

   1. [ ] The 1Password invitation email will be in your Dendron email inbox, please search for it and accept the invitation.
   1. [ ] Install the 1Password app or browser extension on your computer, and link it to your team (GitLab company) account, as described on the [security practices page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/#adding-the-gitlab-team-to-a-1password-app). Please let People Experience or your manager know if you need any assistance.
   1. [ ] Read 1Password's [getting started guides](https://support.1password.com/explore/extension/) and the [Mac app's guide](https://support.1password.com/getting-started-mac/) to understand its functionality.
   1. [ ] Before saving passwords in 1Password, understand why some will be in 1Password remember to save your passwords in your [_Private_ vault](https://support.1password.com/1password-com-items/) (only accessible to you) rather than the team vault (accessible to others at Dendron).

   #### 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)

1. [ ] Dendron requires you to enable 2FA (2-Step Verification, also known as two-factor authentication), because it adds an extra layer of security to your account. You sign in with something you know (your password) and something you have (a code you can copy from your Virtual Multi-Factor authentication Device, like FreeOTP, 1Password or Google Authenticator). Please make sure that time is set automatically on your device (ie. on Android: "Settings" > "Date & Time" > "Set automatically"). If you have problems with 2FA just let the team know! We can disable it for you to then set it up again. Reach out proactively if you're struggling - it's better than getting locked out and needing to wait for IT Ops to help you get back online.
1. [ ] :red_circle: Do the next 3 steps Today. Actually -- why not RIGHT NOW. This absolutely must be done within a week or you will be locked out and need to wait for an admin to get around to helping you get reconnected.
   1. [ ] :red_circle: Enable 2FA on your Dendron email account (Gmail/GSuite) (this should have been an option to do when you first received the invitation to the account).
   1. [ ] :red_circle: Enable [two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/configuring-two-factor-authentication) on your Github account.

##### Rippling

**_This section is super important to ensure payroll + operations support. Please complete these items on your first day if possible._**

1. [ ] Rippling is our HRIS (Human Resource Information System) for all team members. We have self-service enabled so that at any time you can access your account to see your employment information and documentation. As part of onboarding, please make sure to update everything that is applicable to you.
   1. [ ] Access the Rippling [Dashboard](https://app.rippling.com) and make sure you complete any outstanding tasks assigned to you.
   1. [ ] For contractors being paid by the hour, it may be useful to save an invoice template for future use. An invoice template can be found in Google Docs by searching `Invoice Template` or [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1faslC4H_NSLsk8jd8xUuwgAjqhkdSlaI0D1WINA1y9Y/edit#gid=0).
1. [ ] Don't forget to comply with the contract you signed, and make sure you understand [Intellectual Property](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/code-of-conduct/#intellectual-property-and-protecting-ip).

##### Discord

1. [ ] Register on Discord by following this [invitation link](https://discord.gg/xrKTUStHNZ). Read the next suggestions on how to choose a username first.
1. [ ] You can use your personal discord OR choose to create a new username using your Dendron email. It's generally helpful to choose a username to be the same as your Github handle, for consistency and ease of use.
   1. [ ] At Dendron [Transparency](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/b89ba854-72fb-4ebc-a8a0-55960b89e9dc.html#transparencyy) is a value and we prefer to use Public channels in Discord. Continue to use public channels wherever possible (`#dev`), especially if it is a work related discussion (you may be surprised by the feedback you get from the community).
   1. Make sure your Discord profile has a **photo** - it makes it easier for other team members to remember you!
   1. We love to hear more, such as where you were before, family/pets, and hobbies.
   1. We also enjoy pictures if you're willing to share. Consider giving your new team members a glimpse into your world (scroll through previous messages in the channel for inspiration).
1. [ ] If you're new to Discord, a short primer can be found at
       [a Beginner's guide to Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord).
