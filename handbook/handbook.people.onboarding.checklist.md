## Welcome to Dendron!

We are so excited youâ€™re here and look forward to setting you up for remote-first success as your journey begins. Copy this onboarding checklist to user.{alias}.onboarding in the private vault and work through the tasks over the course of your first 30 days. If any task doesn't make sense, please reach out to the team on discord. **Note:** We're really appreciative of Gitlab pioneering the space of remote work and have included a lot of links to the Gitlab handbook. The wealth of information in this note can be overwhelming at times. It's okay to skim through resources, bookmark them and come back at a later time.

- Day 1: [Getting Started: Accounts and Paperwork](#day-1-getting-started-accounts-and-paperwork)
- Day 2: [Morning: Remote Working and our Values](#day-2-remote-working-and-our-values)

### Introduction

This is your core onboarding issue and it is housed in Dendron in the interests of what is known as [dogfooding](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#dogfooding). It has been crafted with the [three dimensions of remote onboarding](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/onboarding/) in mind, namely: Organizational Onboarding, Technical Onboarding and Social Onboarding.

All three of these are underpinned by the sentiments of [lifelong learning](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/b89ba854-72fb-4ebc-a8a0-55960b89e9dc.html#lifelong-learning), while encouraging [asynchronous communication and workflows](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/).

### Support and our Single Source of Truth

Since Dendron aspires to be a [handbook first](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/) organization, the answer to question you may have particularly throughout your first thirty days should be documented and readily available in the [handbook](http://handbook.dendron.so). If you are unable to find the information you are looking for, please reach out on the #dendron-team channel in Discord and update the handbook once you find the answer.

### The First Thirty Days

This note consists of a series of tasks which should be completed sequentially over the course of the next thirty days structured as follows:

| Day         | Area of Focus                                |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Day 01**  | Accounts; Applications and Paperwork         |
| **Day 02**  | Remote Work; Communication and Values        |
| **Day 03**  | Organizational Structure and Social Elements |
| **Day 04**  | Introduction to Dendron and using Github     |
| **Day 05+** | Explore (Various)                            |

Though you may be eager to jump right into your role we encourage you to set aside dedicated time every day for your first week to focus on these tasks as they are geared toward ensuring you are enabled to [thrive in an all-remote environment](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/onboarding/#the-importance-of-onboarding).

### Continuous Improvement

In the interests of paying it forward and contributing to our core value of [Iteration](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/b89ba854-72fb-4ebc-a8a0-55960b89e9dc.html#iteration) - we encourage you to suggest changes and updates to this note and the handbook, both of which can be done via Pull Request (PR).

Along with this you will complete onboarding on Day Thirty by being asked to fill out the [Onboarding Satisfaction Survey](https://airtable.com/shrcILcL6cm6lpCZt), which is an opportunity to share feedback on your general Onboarding Experience.

### Before Starting at Dendron

<details>
<summary>Manager</summary>

1. [ ] Check to see if the new hire's Rippling onboard has been completed, if not send out a reminder.

```eml
Hi {{name}}

Welcome to the team! Here's a couple of things to know for the first day:
1. The information you need is documented at [onboarding instructions](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/09a34445-345d-42c9-b82b-6f6691aed668.html) as well as the detailed [onboarding checklist](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/c6b422a5-204a-41dd-8e47-f0b736160790.html). If you see anything that's confusing or doesn't seem like it applies, please reach out and I can work with you to get that piece updated/documented better.
2. I need to give account access to you on Github/Discord. Could you let me know your ID's so I can do that?
3. I'll be your POC for all things onboarding/paperwork. Feel free to email or discord chat me (<discord alias>).
```

1. [ ] Read through Gitlab's [Building Trust Handbook page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/building-trust/).
1. [ ] Organize a smooth onboarding plan with clear starting tasks and pathway for new team member (copy this note for the team member as a starting point)
1. [ ] Review and add any Job-specific tasks to this note. Complete any manager tasks and coordinate with kpats@ if any changes are needed.

<!--Full time only -->

1. The team members Dendron email address will only be activated on their first day. You can find their personal email address on Rippling.

### Google account

<!--Full time only -->

1.  [ ] Log on to the [Google Admin console](https://admin.google.com/ac/users) and verify the chosen email address is not conflicting with a current account. Then assign the email to team meber and add the email address to [Rippling](https://app.rippling.com/dashboard) in the work email field.

### Accounts and Access

1. [ ] Set new team member's Github group and project-level permissions as needed.

<!-- Full time -->

1. [ ] Invite team member to recurring team meetings, consider pressing `don't send`, this will reduce noise in their inbox on day 1.
1. [ ] Add the team members to the `Dendron Team` role in Discord. This will give them access to the relevant channels.
1. [ ] Schedule weekly [1:1 meetings](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/1-1/) with new team member. Use the first 15 minutes to get to know your new team member on a personal level.
</details>

### Day 1 - Getting Started: Accounts and Paperwork

<details>
<summary>New Team Member</summary>

#### Daily Journal Note

1. [ ] Start the daily journal note for today.

<!-- Hourly -->

1. [ ] Please include two additional frontmatter fields that track the hours you've worked. It should look something like this:

```
---
id: c6b422a5-204a-41dd-8e47-f0b736160790

desc: ""
updated: 1622543447981
created: 1620248731246
hoursToday: 8
hoursMonth: 48
---
```

#### Rpass

1. [ ] :red_circle: Install rpass. Dendron provides all team members with an account to rpass to help manage work credentials.

   - [ ] Detailed instructions TBD.

#### 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)

1. [ ] Dendron requires you to enable 2FA (2-Step Verification, also known as two-factor authentication), because it adds an extra layer of security to your account. You sign in with something you know (your password) and something you have (a code you can copy from your Virtual Multi-Factor authentication Device, like [Authy](https://authy.com), FreeOTP, or Google Authenticator). Please make sure that time is set automatically on your device (ie. on Android: "Settings" > "Date & Time" > "Set automatically"). If you have problems with 2FA just let the team know! We can disable it for you to then set it up again. Reach out proactively if you're struggling - it's better than getting locked out and needing to wait for IT Ops to help you get back online.
1. [ ] :red_circle: Do the next 3 steps Today. Actually -- why not RIGHT NOW. This absolutely must be done within a week or you will be locked out and need to wait for an admin to get around to helping you get reconnected.
   1. [ ] :red_circle: Enable 2FA on your Dendron email account (Gmail/GSuite) (this should have been an option to do when you first received the invitation to the account).
   1. [ ] :red_circle: Enable [two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/configuring-two-factor-authentication) on your Github account.

#### Rippling

**_This section is super important to ensure payroll + operations support. Please complete these items on your first day if possible._**

1. [ ] Rippling is our HRIS (Human Resource Information System) for all team members. We have self-service enabled so that at any time you can access your account to see your employment information and documentation. As part of onboarding, please make sure to update everything that is applicable to you.
   1. [ ] Access the Rippling [Dashboard](https://app.rippling.com) and make sure you complete any outstanding tasks assigned to you.
   1. [ ] For contractors being paid by the hour, it may be useful to save an invoice template for future use. An invoice template can be found in Google Docs by searching `Invoice Template` or [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1faslC4H_NSLsk8jd8xUuwgAjqhkdSlaI0D1WINA1y9Y/edit#gid=0).
1. [ ] Don't forget to comply with the contract you signed, and make sure you understand [Intellectual Property](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/code-of-conduct/#intellectual-property-and-protecting-ip).

#### Discord

1. [ ] Register on Discord by following this [invitation link](https://discord.gg/xrKTUStHNZ). Read the next suggestions on how to choose a username first.
1. [ ] You can use your personal discord OR choose to create a new username using your Dendron email. It's generally helpful to choose a username to be the same as your Github handle, for consistency and ease of use.
   1. [ ] At Dendron [Transparency](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/b89ba854-72fb-4ebc-a8a0-55960b89e9dc.html#transparencyy) is a value and we prefer to use Public channels in Discord. Continue to use public channels wherever possible (`#dev`), especially if it is a work related discussion (you may be surprised by the feedback you get from the community).
   1. Make sure your Discord profile has a **photo** - it makes it easier for other team members to remember you!
1. [ ] If you're new to Discord, a short primer can be found at [a Beginner's guide to Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord).
1. [ ] We also encourage you to message with community members in #questions and #feedback.
   - There are lots of other more informal channels (like #note-taking) where interesting stuff happens so check those out as well.

<!-- Full time -->

1. [ ] Make sure you have access to the #dendron-team channel and post an intro.
   1. We love to hear more, such as where you were before, family/pets, and hobbies.
   1. We also enjoy pictures if you're willing to share. Consider giving your new team members a glimpse into your world (scroll through previous messages in the channel for inspiration).

<summary>New Team Member</summary>

### Remote Work

<!--Trial/Part-time optional-->

1. [ ] The first month at a remote company can be hard. **There is as much to unlearn as there is to learn**. Gitlab's a pioneer in this regard and have put together a great set of tips and tricks that will help. You can view their entire course listed below.
1. [ ] Particularly if you're new to working in a 100% remote environment, read over the [Guide for starting a new remote role](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/getting-started/). You'll find other tips for operating (and thriving!) in an all-remote setting within the [All-Remote section of the Gitlab handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/). Take some inspiration from the folks at Gitlab on how they structure their remote working day, read this helpful blog post [A day in the life of remote worker](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/06/18/day-in-the-life-remote-worker/)
