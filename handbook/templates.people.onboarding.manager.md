Hi {{name}}

Welcome to the team! Here's a couple of things to know for the first day:
1. The information you need is documented at [onboarding instructions](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/09a34445-345d-42c9-b82b-6f6691aed668.html) as well as the detailed [onboarding checklist](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/c6b422a5-204a-41dd-8e47-f0b736160790.html). If you see anything that's confusing or doesn't seem like it applies, please reach out and I can work with you to get that piece updated/documented better.
2. I need to give account access to you on Github/Discord. Could you let me know your ID's so I can do that?
3. I'll be your POC for all things onboarding/paperwork. Feel free to email or discord chat me (<discord alias>).
```

1. [ ] Read through Gitlab's [Building Trust Handbook page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/building-trust/).
1. [ ] Organize a smooth onboarding plan with clear starting tasks and pathway for new team member (copy this note for the team member as a starting point)
