Our mission is to help **people** organize and make sense of any amount information.

We are doing this by building the [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) for general knowledge.

From day one, the words of Vannevar Bush, originator of the [memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex), has been our north star

> "We are overwhelmed with information and we don't have the tools to properly index and filter through it. [The development of these tools, which] will give society access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages [should] be the first objective of our scientist" - Vannevar Bush, 1945

Our goal is to help humans take **command over the inherited knowledge of the ages**. We welcome you to be part of our journey :)
