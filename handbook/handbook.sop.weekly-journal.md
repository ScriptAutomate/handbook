## Summary
<!-- What is this SOP about -->
The weekly journal is how we track tasks and priorities for individuals. It is also a good place to store tasks that are currently blocked or in the future.

Weekly journals should be under `user.{name}.weekly.*`

## Prerequisites
<!-- Optional, anything that needs to be done ahead of time-->

## Process
1. Every monday, create a new weekly journal entry `user.{name}.weekly.{date}`
    - for Dendron, we start the week on Tuesday so have your `date` be the tuesday of the following week
    - eg. for user `bob` starting the process on `2021-09-06`, the next week entry would be `user.bob.journal.2021.09.14`, 
1. Apply the weekly journal template [^1] to your journal

## Checklist
<!-- Should be used to do the task -->
